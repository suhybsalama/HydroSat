# HydroSat Education
Hydrology from Space with Google Earth Engine

## What
Sets of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) written in python to be used with [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) 
## Why
Resources on python API for GEE are limited (mostly in Java) and by HydroSat Education, we hope to serve the community of users and students by simplifying their workflow and accelerating their learning.

## How
The provided Jupyter notebooks can directly be used in [COLAB](https://colab.research.google.com/). Please note, however, that you may need to install some packages to run the codes.



Enjoy and good luck,

Suhyb Salama
