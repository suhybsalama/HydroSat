# HydroSat Education
Hydrology from Space with Google Earth Engine
What: sets of Jupyter Notebooks  using python API on Google Earth Engine 
Why: resources on python API for GEE are limited (mostly in Java) and by HydroSat Education, we hope to serve the community of users and students by simplifying their workflow and accelerating their learning.
